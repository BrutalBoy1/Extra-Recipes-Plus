# Extra-Recipes-Plus
This is the beta release for my mod, some recipes may not function correctly occasionally, but most should be stable.

This mod currently adds 86 new/alt recipes to Minecraft, with more planned in the future.

The recipes include: Chainmail Armor, Disambiguation of most dirt blocks, Pressure Plates (you now get 16 instead of 1; may change), Buttons (you now get 16 instead of 1; may change), Doors (you now get 6 instead of 3), Signs (you now get 6 instead of 3), Horse Armors', and several others that I can't quite categorize.

Made with the help of MCreator.
